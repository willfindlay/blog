# RSS Feed Test

This is a test blog post created to verify that the RSS feed automatically updates when new posts are added to the blog repository.

## Features Being Tested

- Automatic git sync detection
- Cache reload functionality
- RSS feed generation with new posts
- Proper metadata in feed items

## Expected Behavior

When this post is created:

1. The background sync task should detect the change (within 5 minutes)
2. The cache should reload all blog posts atomically
3. The RSS feed should include this post in the next request
4. The post should appear sorted by date (newest first)

If you can see this post in the RSS feed at `/feed.xml` or `/rss.xml`, then the automatic update system is working correctly! ðŸŽ‰

## Test Checklist

- [ ] Post appears in blog listing
- [ ] Post appears in RSS feed
- [ ] Post metadata is correct (title, date, description)
- [ ] Post is sorted correctly by date
- [ ] GUID is properly formatted
